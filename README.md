# Top Ten Leaderboard

This is a small React application built with Vite that presents a 10-position leaderboard for Caro C.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server runs on `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Notes

- Click any row to open a modal containing the position details and a placeholder image.
- The top three entries display gold, silver, and bronze dots next to the position number.
- Replace the placeholder image URL in `src/App.jsx` when you have the final photo.
